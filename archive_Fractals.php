	<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fractals are infinitely complex patterns produced by nature, that are self-similar across different scales. They are tricky to define precisely, though most are linked by a set of four common fractal features: 
				   infinite intricacy, zoom symmetry, complexity from simplicity and fractional dimensions – all of which will be explained below. </font>
	<font size="3"><p><img id="archive_images" src="archive_images/fractal.jpg" width="320" height="217" align="right"/>A fern will provide a great illustration of these features if you pause for a closer look. 
				   First, notice that the shape of the fern is intricately detailed. Remarkably, you can see that the leaves are shaped like little copies of the branches.</p></font>
	<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the entire fern is mostly built up from the same basic shape repeated over and over again at ever smaller scales. Most astonishing of all, fractal mathematics reveals that this humble fern leaf is neither a 
				   one- nor an two-dimensional shape, but hovers somewhere in-between.</font>
	<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we describe a fern as a precise mathematical shape? How can we build a mathematical model of this wonderful object? Enter a completely new world of beautiful shapes: a branch of mathematics known as fractal geometry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Infinite Intricacy</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1861, the discovery of the world’s first fractal sent shockwaves through the mathematical community.<br>
				   If you pick up a pen and doodle a zig-zag, you should end up with a number of sharp corners connected by smooth lines. To show it could be done, the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass constructed a zig-zag that was so jagged, it was nothing but corners - the ultimate mathematical staccato.
				   No matter how many times the shape was magnified, any glimmer of a smooth line would invariably dissolve into a never-ending cascade of corners, packed ever-more tightly together. Weierstrass’ shape had irregular details at every possible scale - the first key feature of a fractal shape.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Zoom Symmetry</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blossoming of fractal geometry into a new branch of mathematics is largely thanks to the Polish-born mathematician Benoît Mandelbröt and his seminal 1977 essay The Fractal Geometry of Nature.
	<br>Perhaps the most famous fractal today is the Mandelbröt set, named after its discoverer. To draw it exactly is impossible, but it can be approximated by painstakingly colouring each point in the plane separately.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Fractional Dimensions</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last and most striking feature of fractals is that are not one-, two- or three-dimensional, but somewhere in-between. Nature seems perfectly happy to use fractional dimensions, so we should be too. In order to do so, we must first clarify what we mean by “dimension”.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of “dimension” has many different (but consistent) mathematical definitions. Intuitively, we can think of a shape’s dimension as a measure of how rough the shape is, or a score that reflects how well the shape fills up its surrounding space.
		These intuitive ideas can be made mathematically precise. To illustrate a fractional dimension, think about a piece of paper, which is (practically) 2-dimensional. A solid sphere is 3-dimensional and fills up more space than the piece of paper.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fractals can be found everywhere in the world around you, from a humble fern to the structure of the universe on the largest of scales.
Even certain parts of your anatomy are fractal, including your brain. If you are mindful of fractals, you will be struck by the sheer variety of places you can find them as you go about your daily routine - from clouds, plants and the landscape to church windows and laboratories …
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fractal mathematics not only allows us to begin modelling the shapes of nature, it can also reawaken our childlike wonder at the world around us.</font></p>
