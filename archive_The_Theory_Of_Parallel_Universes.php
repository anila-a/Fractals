	<font size="5" face="Berlin Sans FB">The Theory of Parallel Universes</font>
	<div class="hline"></div>
	<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multiverse is a theory in which our universe is not the only one, but states that many universes exist parallel to each other. These distinct universes 
                within the multiverse theory are called parallel universes. A variety of different theories lend themselves to a multiverse viewpoint.</font>
	<font size="3"><p><img id="archive_images" src="archive_images/paralleluniverse.jpg" width="370" height="210" align="right"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all physicists really believe that these universes exist. 
                Even fewer believe that it would ever be possible to contact these parallel universes.</p></font>
	<font size="3"><b>Level 1: If you go far enough, you'll get back home.</b></font><p>
        <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of Level 1 parallel universes basically says that space is so big that the rules of probability imply that surely, somewhere else out there, are other 
                planets exactly like Earth. In fact, an infinite universe would have infinitely many planets, and on some of them, the events that play out would be virtually identical to those on our own Earth.</font>
	<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don’t see these other universes because our cosmic vision is limited by the speed of light — the ultimate speed limit. Light started traveling at the moment of the big bang, 
                about 14 billion years ago, and so we can’t see any further than about 14 billion light-years (a bit farther, since space is expanding). This volume of space is called the Hubble volume and represents our observable universe.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of Level 1 parallel universes depends on two assumptions: the universe is infinite (or virtually so), and within an infinite universe, every single possible configuration of particles in a Hubble volume takes place multiple times.<br>
                If Level 1 parallel universes do exist, reaching one is virtually (but not entirely) impossible. For one thing, we wouldn’t know where to look for one because, by definition, a Level 1 parallel universe is so far away that no message can ever get from us to them, or them to us. 
                (Remember, we can only get messages from within our own Hubble volume.)</font></p>
        <font size="3"><b>Level 2: If you go far enough, you'll fall into wonderland.</b></font><p>
        <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Level 2 parallel universe, regions of space are continuing to undergo an inflation phase. Because of the continuing inflationary phase in these universes, space between us and the other universes is literally expanding faster than the speed of 
                light — and they are, therefore, completely unreachable.</font>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two possible theories present reasons to believe that Level 2 parallel universes may exist: eternal inflation and ekpyrotic theory.<br>
                In eternal inflation, recall that the quantum fluctuations in the early universe’s vacuum energy caused bubble universes to be created all over the place, expanding through their inflation stages at different rates. The initial condition of these universes is 
                assumed to be at a maximum energy level, although at least one variant, chaotic inflation, predicts that the initial condition can be chaotically chosen as any energy level, which may have no maximum, and the results will be the same.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of eternal inflation mean that when inflation starts, it produces not just one universe, but an infinite number of universes.</font></p>
        <font size="3"><b>Level 3: If you stay where you are, you'll run into yourself.</b></font><p>
        <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Level 3 parallel universe is a consequence of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) from quantum physics in which every single quantum possibility inherent in the quantum wavefunction becomes a real possibility in some reality. When the average person 
                (especially a science fiction fan) thinks of a “parallel universe,” he’s probably thinking of Level 3 parallel universes.</font>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3 parallel universes are different from the others posed because they take place in the same space and time as our own universe, but you still have no way to access them. You have never had and will never have contact with any Level 1 or 
                Level 2 universe (we assume), but you’re continually in contact with Level 3 universes — every moment of your life, every decision you make, is causing a split of your “now” self into an infinite number of future selves, all of which are unaware of each other.<p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the four types of universes, Level 3 parallel universes have the least to do with string theory directly.</font></p>
                <font size="3"><b>Level 4: Somewhere over the rainbow, there's a magic land.</b></font><p>
        <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Level 4 parallel universe is the strangest place (and most controversial prediction) of all, because it would follow fundamentally different mathematical laws of nature than our universe. In short, any universe that physicists can get to work out 
                on paper would exist, based on the mathematical democracy principle: Any universe that is mathematically possible has equal possibility of actually existing.</font>
